# 🌾 FarmAgent
**AI-Powered Platform for Fake Fertilizer Detection & Smart Farming**

FarmAgent is an AI-driven web application built to protect farmers from fake fertilizers and enable smarter farming decisions using **computer vision, product verification, and soil analysis**. The project focuses on real-world usability, low-cost deployment, and scalability across rural and semi-urban farming ecosystems.

---

## Problem Statement

Fake and substandard fertilizers are a serious issue in agriculture:

- Farmers face yield loss due to ineffective or harmful inputs  
- Counterfeit fertilizers damage long-term soil health  
- No easy verification tools exist at the farmer level  
- Affordable soil testing and advisory systems are limited  

FarmAgent solves this using **AI + web technology**, accessible directly from a browser or smartphone.

## Project Goals

- Detect **fake vs genuine fertilizers** using image-based AI  
- Enable **QR / Fertilizer ID verification** for authenticity checks  
- Provide **AI-based soil quality analysis**  
- Build a foundation for **Agentic AI in farming**  
- Empower farmers with **trust, transparency, and data-driven decisions**

## What FarmAgent Does

FarmAgent currently delivers **three core capabilities**:

### 1️⃣ Fake Fertilizer Detection (Image AI)
- Farmers upload or capture fertilizer images  
- AI classifies products as **Genuine** or **Fake**  
- Built using Google Teachable Machine  
- Runs fully in the browser (no backend required)

### 2️⃣ Fertilizer Authenticity Verification (QR / ID-Based)
- Each genuine fertilizer has a **unique ID / QR code**  
- Farmers scan or manually enter the ID  
- System verifies against a trusted database (`genuine.json`)  
- Prevents counterfeit distribution at the supply chain level

### 3️⃣ AI-Based Soil Quality Analysis
- Image-based soil classification (color, texture, moisture cues)  
- Outputs soil quality in **percentage confidence**  
- Works with low-cost inputs like phone cameras  
- Designed for future fertilizer & crop recommendations

---

## How It Works

1. User uploads product or soil images  
2. TensorFlow.js runs AI models locally in the browser  
3. Product IDs are verified against genuine records  
4. Clear, farmer-friendly results are shown  

No heavy backend → lightweight, fast, scalable.

## Vision: Agentic AI for Farming

FarmAgent is a step toward **Agentic Farming AI**, where AI systems:

- Observe (soil, inputs, crops)  
- Decide (what fertilizer, when, how much)  
- Act (recommendations, alerts, optimization)  

Moving farming from **reactive** to **intelligent & proactive**.

---

## Future Roadmap

- Multi-class fertilizer classification  
- Real-time camera scanning  
- Regional language support  
- Soil–fertilizer–crop recommendation engine  
- Blockchain-backed fertilizer traceability  
- Offline-first Progressive Web App (PWA)
